## 🚀 Repository Structure

```js
node.js-practical-problems/
├── README.md
├── 01-hello-world-node-problem/ (submodule)
├── 02-read-file-node-problem/ (submodule)
├── 03-write-file-node-problem/ (submodule)
└── ...
```

Each problem resides in its own repository and is added here as a submodule. This structure ensures modularity and flexibility for learning.

## 🛠️ How to Get Started

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/anirudha-8/node.js-practical-problems.git
   ```

   This will clone the main repository along with all the submodules.

2. **Initialize Submodules (if not cloned with recurse-submodules):**

   ```bash
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```

3. **Navigate to a Problem Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd problem-1-simple-server
   ```

4. **Follow the Instructions in Each Problem's README:**
   Each submodule repository contains its own `README.md` with problem-specific details.
